      <h3>Initial Situation</h3>
      <p>As DigitalOcean scaled its product ecosystem in preparation for IPO, a central problem emerged: Developers loved individual products — but weren't adopting more than one. Despite high satisfaction scores, usage data revealed a gap: multi-product adoption rates were low.</p>
      
      <p>Product teams optimized their verticals, but no one owned the horizontal experience. I was brought in to lead a strategic, cross-functional research initiative to map the end-to-end developer journey, surface transition friction, and build a shared understanding of how platform cohesion was breaking down.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="case-section">
      <h3>Research Mission</h3>
      <p>Diagnose where — and why — developers were failing to adopt across product lines, by:</p>
      <ul style="margin-left: var(--space-xl); margin-bottom: var(--space-md);">
        <li>Mapping the real sequence of onboarding, building, scaling, and expanding</li>
        <li>Identifying the emotional, technical, and support-based friction that wasn't visible from within any single team</li>
        <li>Creating an artifact that could align PMs, leadership, and GTM around the real developer journey</li>

        <span>Key Artifact</span>

      <img src="artifacts/developer-journey-map.svg" alt="Developer Experience Atlas - Journey Map" class="artifact-img">
      
      <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This map revealed the critical points where developers experienced friction when moving between products. It visualized actions, emotions, support needs, friction points, and opportunities across the journey from onboarding to multi-product expansion.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Impact:</strong> This artifact became the foundation for cross-product strategic planning and was utilized in employee onboarding to create a shared understanding of the developer journey.</p>

      <h3>Key Insights</h3>
      
      <div class="key-insights">
        <div class="insight-card">
          <h4>Friction Lived Between Products, Not Inside Them</h4>
          <p>Satisfaction was high within silos — but transition points between products revealed unmet needs, mismatched expectations, and broken workflows.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="insight-card">
          <h4>No One Owned Graduation Moments</h4>
          <p>As developers matured (e.g., from solo to team), there were critical points where they needed new features — but didn't know they existed, or couldn't adopt them smoothly.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="insight-card">
          <h4>Documentation and Support Were Misaligned with UI Flow</h4>
          <p>Developers frequently switched between docs, dashboards, and support for guidance — but these systems were out of sync, creating confusion and dropout risk.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="insight-card">
          <h4>Developer Churn Was Preventable — but Invisible</h4>
          <p>Without a holistic view, teams were missing moments where developers silently disengaged. In one case, a 4-click UI gap led to over 30% drop-off from multi-product usage.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="case-section">
      <h3>Organizational Influence</h3>
      
      <div class="metrics">
        <p><strong>Revenue Impact:</strong> Increased ARPU by 15% among cohorts exposed to cross-product nudges informed by the Atlas</p>
        <p><strong>Organizational Adoption:</strong> Integrated into employee onboarding as a strategic artifact for new hires in product, design, and CX</p>
        <p><strong>IPO Influence:</strong> Cited in IPO S-1 filing as part of the company's understanding of developer lifecycle and engagement</p>
      </div>
      
      <p>The Developer Experience Atlas influenced roadmap direction for account management, onboarding, and multi-product UI. It highlighted support+docs gaps that led to unified experience planning across previously siloed teams.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="case-section">
      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>This case exemplified what I believe research is capable of at its best: Surfacing what no one team can see alone — and aligning the entire system around the user's lived reality. By creating a map of the unowned spaces — the in-between — we turned a fragmented set of tools into the foundation for a more cohesive platform.</p>
      
      <p>It wasn't just a research win. It was a cultural shift in how the company thought about experience, responsibility, and growth.</p>
